This code implements a machine learning pipeline to predict student grades (using linear regression) and employment status (using logistic regression) based on historical data.

**Data Sources**:

mark.csv: Stores student marks.
student.csv: Contains additional student information like age, gender, and employment status.
Methodology:

**Data Loading and Merging**:

Leverages pandas to efficiently load data from CSV files.
Merges the two DataFrames using pd.merge to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

Employs combined_df.isnull().sum() to identify and handle missing values.
Categorical features are meticulously transformed:
'Employed': Encoded as 1 (employed) and 0 (not employed).
'Grade': Converted to a numerical scale (1st Class = 3, 2nd Class = 2, 3rd Class = 1) using a defined mapping dictionary.
'Gender': Encoded as 1 (male) and 0 (female).

**Data exploration is conducted through**:
Descriptive statistics (combined_df.describe()) to understand data distribution.
Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots) created with seaborn for deeper insights.
Interquartile Range (IQR) is calculated to identify potential outliers within the data.
Model Building:

**Linear Regression for Grade Prediction**:

Carefully defines features (features) and the target variable (target).
Employs train_test_split from scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets for robust model evaluation.
Creates and trains a linear regression model (LinearRegression) to model the relationship between features and numeric grades.
Generates predictions on unseen data (X_test) to assess model generalizability.

**Logistic Regression for Employment Prediction**:

Defines features (features) and the target variable (target) for employment prediction.
Strategically splits the data into training and testing sets (train_test_split) to ensure model evaluation on unseen data.
Creates and trains a logistic regression model (LogisticRegression) to classify students as employed or not employed.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy (accuracy_score) to gauge its effectiveness in predicting employment status.
Trains the model on the entire dataset for future predictions on new data points.
Generates predictions on new data (X_new) to demonstrate model applicability.
Calculates comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC score, confusion matrix) using scikit-learn to provide a detailed assessment of the model's performance on the testing set.

**Outputs:**

The code outputs valuable results, including:
Predicted grades for all data points (linear regression).
Model accuracy for employment prediction (logistic regression).
Predictions for employment status on new data points (logistic regression).
A comprehensive evaluation report with various metrics for the logistic regression model on the testing set.

**Assumptions:**

The provided CSV files (mark.csv and student.csv) are assumed to have the expected format and column names.
Feature names in the code (features) are presumed to match the actual column names in the combined DataFrame (combined_df).
Encoded categorical features ('Gender') are assumed to be used for model training (one-hot encoding might be necessary depending on the chosen model).

**Libraries Used**:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
scikit-learn
